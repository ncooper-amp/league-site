        It’ll ask you to sign in, so just sign up.
        One or two things needs to happen when you sign up; firstly i need to approve you, i get an email once you sign up, so this usually happens quite quickly, secondly you may get a verification email - this is sometimes delayed a little, but again i can see if it's delayed so i'll keep you informed<br /><br />
        Once you're verified and approved it's relatively straightforward, either use the link in the Admin menu or visit the link above again<br /><br />
        You can use the results entry form on your phone or laptop – it still needs a scan / photo of the scorecard (so doing on your mobile is pretty handy since it means you can just snap a picture when you get to that step)<br /><br />
        It doesn’t alter the website, it’s just an alternative to the spreadsheet + scan solution we’ve currently got and removes the dependence on excel/sheets/numbers or whatever people are using.<br />
        If you get stuck, or something doesn't work as you expect it to let me know and i'll see what i can do to improve it.<br />
        If you struggle to upload a picture, or it's blocked somehow feel free to just email the picture to me.
